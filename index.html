        This is my website! I keep a lot of things here, most of them because I find them interesting, or perhaps
        because I don't want to forget about them. I hope you enjoy browsing this website as much as I enjoyed making
        it.

      <h2>About this website</h2>
      <p>
        This website is pretty simple. Right now, I write the HTML for it by hand - no generators. I'm a big fan of
        <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">various</a>
        <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">efforts</a> to use HTML's existing qualities for accessibility
        and design. I think that the web should be designed around simple, handmade things and believe that I can be a
        part of that.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website uses <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> and
        <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">Highlight.js</a> to render math and code; however, I intend for this site to
        be readable even without them enabled. Feel free to disable scripts if you like.
