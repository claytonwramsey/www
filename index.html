  Hi! Thanks for checking out this website. 
  I made it myself! 
  This website was made by hand. 
  I intentionally haven't minified anything so you can see how it all fits together.

    <h1>Clayton's Website</h1>
    <p>
      This is my website! I keep a lot of things here, most of them because I
      find them interesting, or perhaps because I don't want to forget about
      them. I hope you enjoy browsing it as much as I enjoyed making them.

    <h2>Why does this website look so simple?</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a big fan of
      <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">Motherfucking Website</a> and
      its counterpart
      <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">
        Better Motherfucking Website</a
      >. I think that the web should be designed around simple, handmade things
      and believe that I can be a part of that.
