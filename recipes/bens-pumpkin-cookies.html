        A really nice recipe for soft, tasty pumpkin cookies. I adapted it from one I found on
        <a href="https://www.benovermyer.com/recipe/pumpkin-cookies/">Ben Overmyer's website</a>
        with a few modifications.

      <p>This recipe is scaled to make around 50 cookies and takes about 1 hour.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 15oz can pureed pumpkin</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>4 cups flour</li>
        <li>4 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tsp nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>4 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>2 tsp milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups dark chocolate chips</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Combine all ingredients except chocolate chips. The resulting dough should be noticeably softer and wetter
          than normal cookie dough.
        </li>
        <li>Seal in a plastic bag and let rest in the refrigerator at least 30 minutes; preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350&deg; F.</li>
        <li>Mix chocolate chips into the dough.</li>
        <li>Cover a pan with parchment paper. Spoon out dough into medium-size balls, roughly 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake 15 minutes in the middle rack.</li>
      </ol>
