      A really nice recipe for soft, tasty pumpkin cookies. I adapted it from one I found on
      <a href="https://www.benovermyer.com/recipe/pumpkin-cookies/">Ben Overmyer's website</a>
      with a few modifications.

    <p>This recipe is scaled to make around 50 cookies and takes about 1 hour.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 15oz can pureed pumpkin</li>
      <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>4 cups flour</li>
      <li>4 tsp cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 tsp nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>4 tsp baking powder</li>
      <li>2 tsp baking soda</li>
      <li>2 tsp milk</li>
      <li>2 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 cups dark chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine all ingredients except chocolate chips. The resulting dough should be noticeably
        softer and wetter than normal cookie dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Seal in a plastic bag and let rest in the refrigerator at least 30 minutes; preferably
        overnight.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350&deg; F.</li>
      <li>Mix chocolate chips into the dough.</li>
      <li>
        Cover a pan with parchment paper. Spoon out dough into medium-size balls, roughly 2 inches
        apart.
      </li>
      <li>Bake 15 minutes in the middle rack.</li>
    </ol>
