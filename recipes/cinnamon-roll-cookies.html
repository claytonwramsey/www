    <p>
      These aren't really cinnamon rolls, but they aren't really cookies either. This recipe is
      scaled to make around 36 cookies and takes about 2 hours.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 sticks butter, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 cup sugar</li>
      <li>0.5 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>2.5 cups flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 stick butter</li>
      <li>0.5 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>4 tsp cinnamon</li>
      <li>4 tsp cocoa powder</li>
      <li>4 tsp flour</li>
      <li>0.5 tsp salt</li>
      <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the dough ingredients in a large bowl until mixed thoroughly and stretchy. Cover and
        let rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>Combine the filling ingredients. The filling should be wet and sticky.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 F.</li>
      <li>
        Retrieve dough from the refrigerator. Roll out into a flat sheet, roughly 6 inches wide and
        1/8 inches thick. I recommend splitting the dough into 4 parts to make this process easier.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread filling in a thin layer over the dough, leaving a 1 inch strip on the edge uncovered.
        Roll up the dough, starting from the uncovered strip, until you have a single roll, roughly
        1.5 inches in diameter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice dough into rounds, roughly 1/4 inch thick. Cover a baking sheet in parchment paper and
        place the rounds on the sheet.
      </li>
      <li>Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
