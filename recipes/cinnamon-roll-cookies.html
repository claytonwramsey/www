        These aren't really cinnamon rolls, but they aren't really cookies either. This recipe is scaled to make around
        36 cookies and takes about 2 hours.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <h3>Dough</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 sticks butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2.5 cups flour</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Filling</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 stick butter</li>
        <li>0.5 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>4 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>4 tsp cocoa powder</li>
        <li>4 tsp flour</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Combine the dough ingredients in a large bowl until mixed thoroughly and stretchy. Cover and let rest in the
          refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>Combine the filling ingredients. The filling should be wet and sticky.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 F.</li>
        <li>
          Retrieve dough from the refrigerator. Roll out into a flat sheet, roughly 6 inches wide and 1/8 inches thick.
          I recommend splitting the dough into 4 parts to make this process easier.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spread filling in a thin layer over the dough, leaving a 1 inch strip on the edge uncovered. Roll up the
          dough, starting from the uncovered strip, until you have a single roll, roughly 1.5 inches in diameter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Slice dough into rounds, roughly 1/4 inch thick. Cover a baking sheet in parchment paper and place the rounds
          on the sheet.
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
      </ol>
