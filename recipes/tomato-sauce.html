      <p>My mother's recipe for tomato sauce. It's quite hearty, and, more importantly, quite cheap.</p>
      <p>This recipe makes about 8 to 10 servings. It takes roughly 1 hour to make.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 sticks celery, chopped</li>
        <li>2 bell peppers, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tbsp garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 lb ground Italian sausage</li>
        <li>32 oz canned diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>16 oz canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>6 oz canned tomato paste</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Italian seasoning</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat a large pot on the stove. Saut√© onion, sticks, celery, bell peppers, and garlic in oil until clear.
        </li>
        <li>Add sausage, slicing with a spatula until mixed and mostly cooked, approx. 5 min.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste. Bring to a simmer, the longer the better.</li>
        <li>Add seasonings to taste. Serve over pasta.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use whatever vegetables you like in this recipe. I don't like black olives, but you can definitely add them if
          you like them.
