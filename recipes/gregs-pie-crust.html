        A simple crust that can be used for any dessert pie that you like. I originally got this recipe from Greg, who
        was an RA at my dorm when I was in undegrad.
      </p>
      <p>
        This recipe should be enough to make at least one pie, but could even be enough for two if you have a small tin.
        It takes roughly 2 hours to make.
      </p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2.5 cups flour</li>
        <li>0.25 cups sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 cup cold butter, cubed</li>
        <li>0.5 cups + 1 tsp buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix flour, salt, sugar, and butter until mixture resembles coarse meal.</li>
        <li>Mix in 0.5 cups buttermilk.</li>
        <li>
          Flatten into two disks, each roughly 1/4" thick. Store in refrigerator at least 1 hour; preferably overnight.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425&deg; F.</li>
        <li>
          Prepare your preferred filling. Roll out the dough into a flat sheet and assemble the pie to your liking.
        </li>
        <li>Beat an egg with 1 tbsp buttermilk. Brush surface of pie with egg wash.</li>
        <li>Bake 15 minutes at 425&deg; F, then reduce temperature to 350&deg; F; bake 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pie from oven; let cool for 30 minutes.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If you place the pie higher in the oven, it'll get a crispier top crust, which I prefer.</li>
        <li>
          The filling for a pie is much less a science than an art. I recommend getting roughly 5 pounds of fruit,
          cutting it into thin slices, and mixing it with cinnamon, brown sugar, and nutmeg. Arrange the slices in a
          geometric pattern inside the pie. Melt 0.5 cups butter and mix in brown sugar until you have a thick syrup,
          then pour the syrup over the fruit.
        </li>
      </ul>
