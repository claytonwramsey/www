    <p>
      A simple crust that can be used for any dessert pie that you like. I originally got this
      recipe from Greg, who was an RA at my dorm when I was in undegrad.
    </p>
    <p>
      This recipe should be enough to make at least one pie, but could even be enough for two if you
      have a small tin. It takes roughly 2 hours to make.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2.5 cups flour</li>
      <li>0.25 cups sugar</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 cup cold butter, cubed</li>
      <li>0.5 cups + 1 tsp buttermilk</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix flour, salt, sugar, and butter until mixture resembles coarse meal.</li>
      <li>Mix in 0.5 cups buttermilk.</li>
      <li>
        Flatten into two disks, each roughly 1/4" thick. Store in refrigerator at least 1 hour;
        preferably overnight.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 425&deg; F.</li>
      <li>
        Prepare your preferred filling. Roll out the dough into a flat sheet and assemble the pie to
        your liking.
      </li>
      <li>Beat an egg with 1 tbsp buttermilk. Brush surface of pie with egg wash.</li>
      <li>
        Bake 15 minutes at 425&deg; F, then reduce temperature to 350&deg; F; bake 40 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Remove pie from oven; let cool for 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you place the pie higher in the oven, it'll get a crispier top crust, which I prefer.
      </li>
      <li>
        The filling for a pie is much less a science than an art. I recommend getting roughly 5
        pounds of fruit, cutting it into thin slices, and mixing it with cinnamon, brown sugar, and
        nutmeg. Arrange the slices in a geometric pattern inside the pie. Melt 0.5 cups butter and
        mix in brown sugar until you have a thick syrup, then pour the syrup over the fruit.
      </li>
    </ul>
