Friday, five P.M., or perhaps six.
I send my last email, write my last commit, and make for the door.
It's autumn now, and the sun hangs ever lower.
For now, though there's a few hours of light left.
Pop music, coming down from on high atop the tallest student dorm, caroms off my office's brick walls; among the garbles and echoes I can barely make out the lyrics to "Pink Pony Club."
Teenagers and twenty-somethings and I trickle out of the buildings, scattering like ants for the parking lots.

Donning my helmet, I straddle my bike.
With each stroke I lurch forward a little faster, gliding slowly away from the bent-steel rack up an alleyway.
Suddenly, I stop:

- Sunset boulevard
- Bissonet street
- Boulevard oaks and Poe elementary
- I-69
- The liquor store
- You are being recorded

TODO:

- contact TxDOT for photos?
- do some research on history of construction of the neighborhood?
