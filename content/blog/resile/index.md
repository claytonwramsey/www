Introduction to my project!!!

## The soul of a new project

- CAPT work is done, motion planning is free!
- Maybe we can take TAMP into the online domain
- I spend a lot of time preparing presentations, browsing lobste.rs

## Juggling priorities

<figure>

```typ,include=els_tree.typ

```

</figure>

- Explain how ELS works
- also, classes and grading require my time and soul

## Another day, another CMake error

- Serious work on project begins in the fall
- Assembling dependencies:
  - VAMP
  - SymK
  - IKFast
  - probably some others?
- Every dependency takes loads of time and soul

## A skunk's work

- Rust side project rewriting the motion planner in Rust
- Started in the fall, but earnest development over winter break
- Finally achieve good perf numbers at start of spring semester
- Maybe a rewrite is possible?
- Screw it, I'll rewrite it myself

## Harder, better, faster, stronger

- Spend a lot of time optimizing the new conventional TAMP solver
- Cut out SymK as a dependency
- Trying to become a more independent worker

## Running it back

<figure>

```typ,include=meta_tree.typ

```

</figure>

- Original idea for a meta-ELS

## Getting relaxed

<figure>

```typ,include=roll_backward.typ

```

</figure>

- First meta-ELS idea fails; relaxing the problem to produce solvable goal constraints

## Running it forward

<figure>

```typ,include=roll_forward.typ

```

## Benching and marking

## Publiculating

## Auslaut
