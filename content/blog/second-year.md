## Establishing my own direction

- Big theme of this year is being an independent researcher, picking topics that I want to work on
- This also involved spending a lot of time spinning my wheels with no clue of what to do
- But I feel like I've grown a lot!
- My current strategy for finding good research projects is to just do stuff that would be fun to implement.
  Unknown if this will work out in the long run but it is very good for my morale.

## Getting blocked

- I struggle a lot with focusing
- Getting blocked on a task makes this even harder
- I also am not very good at asking for help and involving others in my work
- the evil loop: fall behind, feel bad, stop interacting with the project because it makes me feel bad
- Exacerbated by many family health issues; it felt like I struggled to muster time and focus even more than usual this year or so

## Having fun with my tools

- Rewriting my entire stack in Rust was actually a great decision.
- Massive disrespect to the people who say you shouldn't do a rewrite lol

## A spot of hope?

- I finally have a project that's approaching the finish line
- I feel like I now can set my own research directions, _but_
- I still struggle with time management, staying focused, and motivation
- getting better (ish?) at it though
