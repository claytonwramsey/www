My mothers recipe for tomato sauce. Its quite hearty, and, more
importantly, quite cheap.

This recipe makes about 8 to 10 servings. It takes roughly 1 hour to
make.

## Ingredients

- Olive oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 4 sticks celery, chopped
- 2 bell peppers, chopped
- 2 tbsp garlic, minced
- 1 lb ground Italian sausage
- 32 oz canned diced tomatoes
- 16 oz canned tomato sauce
- 6 oz canned tomato paste
- Salt
- Pepper
- Italian seasoning

## Directions

1.  Heat a large pot on the stove. Saut√© onion, sticks, celery, bell
    peppers, and garlic in oil until clear.
2.  Add sausage, slicing with a spatula until mixed and mostly cooked,
    approx. 5 min.
3.  Add tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste. Bring to a simmer, the
    longer the better.
4.  Add seasonings to taste. Serve over pasta.

## Notes

- Use whatever vegetables you like in this recipe. I dont like black
  olives, but you can definitely add them if you like them.
