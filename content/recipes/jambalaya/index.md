A spicy jambalaya recipe. I got the base for this recipe from Matt and
Bobby, who were RAs for my dorm in undergrad, but I've made my own
modifications.

This recipe makes about 8 to 10 servings. It takes roughly 2 hours to
make.

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp bacon fat
- 1.5 lb chicken, cubed
- 1.5 lb pork but, cubed
- 1 lb andouille sausage, sliced
- 8 tbsp ground paprika
- 6 tbsp ground cayenne pepper
- 5 tbsp ground black pepper
- 6 tbsp garlic powder
- 3 tbsp onion powder
- 6 tbsp salt
- 2.5 tbsp dried oregano
- 2.5 tbsp dried thyme
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 head celery, chopped
- 2 bell peppers, chopped
- 1/4 cup garlic, minced
- 7 cups chicken stock
- 1 cup green onions, sliced
- 0.5 cup parsley, chopped
- 4 cups long grain rice, dry

## Directions

1.  In a large mixing bowl, combine meat and spices.
2.  Heat a large cast-iron Dutch oven on the stove and add bacon fat. If
    desired, you can simply fry some bacon in the pot to get your bacon
    fat.
3.  Saut√© meat until dark brown and sticking to bottom of pan, approx.
    10 min.
4.  Add onions, celery, bell peppers, and garlic. Stir-fry 10 min.
5.  Add chicken stock and bring to a rolling boil, then reduce to a
    simmer for 15 min.
6.  Add green onions, parsley, and rice; stir thoroughly.
7.  Cover and let steam until rice is cooked, approx 30 min., stirring
    once at 15 min.
