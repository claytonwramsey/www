Hi! I'm Clayton Ramsey, a PhD student studying computer science at Rice
University. In my free time, I figure skate, swing dance, and write a
little code.

Most of my research focuses on algorithmic robotics, but I also work on
chess engines as a side gig. I've been working on my current engine,
Fiddler, for a few years. Check it out
[here!](https://github.com/claytonwramsey/fiddler)
