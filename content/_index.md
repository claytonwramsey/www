This is my website! I keep a lot of things here, most of them because I find them interesting, or perhaps
because I don't want to forget about them. I hope you enjoy browsing this website as much as I enjoyed making
it.

Check out the links up at the top if you'd like to explore.

## About this website

This website is pretty simple.
It's currently generated via [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) with a custom lightweight theme.
I'm a big fan of [various](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com)
[efforts](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com) to use HTML's existing
qualities for accessibility and design. I think that the web should be
designed around simple, handmade things and believe that I can be a part
of that.

Everything on this website, unless otherwise specified, is written by hand by me.
I don't use generative models for any of the text or images found on this website; for a reasoning, check my article on [why I'd rather read the prompt](/blog/prompt).
