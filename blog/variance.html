        A useful bit of inference yields spooky action at a distance. Steve Klabnik, one of the key contributors to the
        Rust project, wrote what he calls <dfn>Rust's Golden Rule</dfn>:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Whenever the body of a function contradicts the function's signature, the signature takes precedence; the
        signature is right and the body is wrong.

      <p>
        I think we can extend this rule to get an overall philosophy for Rust:
        <strong>all compilation-relevant information must be stored in the signature of a type</strong>. In other words,
        any changes to the body of a function or the contents of a structure which don't also violate the signature
        should also not break compilation.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are unfortunately a lot of exceptions to this rule, usually on the fuzzy edges of Rust where systems
        interact. Auto-traits are the biggest one, especially <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code>, as well as
        mutability. But there's one case which I think is quite egregious, but very few people ever interact with it.
      </p>
      <h2>Variance</h2>
      <p>Quick: what's the difference between these two structures?</p>
      <pre class="rust"><code>struct Foo&lt;T&gt;(*const T);
struct Bar&lt;T&gt;(*mut T);</code></pre>
      <p>
        Other than their fields, they've got the same signature, so we would like to think that they have the same
        semantics. The problem is that's not true in Rust:
