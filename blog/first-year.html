        I'm no wiser than last year, but at least I know a few more things. August 16 marks one year of Ph.D. research,
        so I'm writing up my experience with grad school for the sake of prospective grad students and also as a time
        capsule for myself. Overall, my experience so far was a huge success! I've had a lot of fun, made new friends,
        and produced surprisingly good work, and I'm excited for the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a brief greatest-hits list, I'll note some of the big milestones I achieved in the past year below &mdash;
        some personal and some professional.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I won two fellowships (<a

        </li>
        <li>
          I wrote a whole conference paper for <a href="/blog/captree">a project</a> and presented it at
          <a href="https://roboticsconference.org">RSS</a>.
        </li>
        <li>I started learning Mandarin!</li>
        <li>I started ballroom dancing and also got a lot better at Lindy hop.</li>
        <li>
          I passed my senior solo free dance test for my third "<a

            >gold medal</a

      <h2>Finding the fun</h2>
      <p>
        The common wisdom about graduate studies is that it requires extraordinary self-discipline: a doctoral
        researcher is free to do whatever they want, so they must direct themselves with little outside guidance. Sadly,
        I am wildly undisciplined. I <em>hate</em> working on boring things, and as soon as I have to actually engage
        with something I don't like, I give up and do something else, even if I cared about my original task.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps the best case of this was when I was working on my fellowship applications. I like writing, but don't
        enjoy selling myself and find the whole statement-writing process distasteful. Whenever I tried to make progress
        on them, I would just stare at the document and feel bad about my terminally slow progress. If this blog post
        were a fellowship statement, I'd have to come up with some heartwarming story about how I eventually made it
        suck less, but the truth is I didn't. The process is miserable and I only finished the applications by sucking
        it up and pounding some words out at the very last minute.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps the long-term takeaway is that I have to stick to fun projects, or at least find ways of making projects
        fun for myself. I'm happiest when deep in the weeds of high-performance systems programming, and I don't mind
        debugging convoluted multithreaded algorithms &mdash; lockless algorithms hold a special place in my heart.
        However, dependency management, Python, Docker, hyperparameter tuning, and all that is just exhausting to me in
        a way that makes me want to quit immediately. I guess I'm just not cut out for machine learning.
      </p>
      <h2>Marketing and more</h2>
      <p>Many academics, myself included, are quiet and reserved. This is exclusively to our detriment.</p>
      <p>
        I traveled to two conferences this year, and my biggest takeaway is that advertisement, connections, and
        presentation dominate career outcomes. When presenting work outwards, flashcraft often beats substance. If you
        want attention for your work, you have to come up with a sufficiently dramatic and exciting demonstration. On
        the converse, there's an extraodinary amount of research out there which is excellent in quality but poorly
        advertised (in addition to some poor-quality, poorly-advertised work).
      </p>
      <p>
        When I presented my research at RSS, I had a pretty
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzDKdrU1VpM">nice demo</a> of a robt arm dodging pool noodles as we
        waved them around the lab. When I made my presentations for my work, I got some really excellent advice: move
        the demo to the very front of the presentation to catch the audience's attention. This worked very well, and I
        was told my talk was quite memorable. I think more than a few attendees knew me as "pool noodle guy;" so to
        speak, the demo was much more remarkable than the rest of the methodology.
      </p>
      <h2>Getting sidetracked</h2>
      <p>
        I try very hard to have things that I do for fun outside of grad school. You might notice that I stopped writing
        technical blog posts this spring - that's because I didn't want to spend all day coding and writing to come home
        to more coding and writing!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I've picked up a lot of non-technical hobbies. I started dancing a few years ago, but now I dance a lot more
        often and do a lot more styles. Although figure skating took something of a back burner for me when I was in
        undergrad, I'm now making an effort to regularly practice. I also tried learning to play guitar and re-learning
        playing saxophone, but I bounced off of both (music is too hard!).
      </p>
      <p>
        But the biggest side-thing I've gotten into recently is learning a new language, namely, Mandarin. I realized
        that graduate students at my university have free tuition, and on a whim last winter I decided to take advantage
        of that. I signed up for introductory Chinese and since haven't looked back. I'm not sure how far I'll go with
        it, but so far I'm having a great time. According to Anki, I've spent some 56 hours practicing vocabulary so
        far, and I've probably done about that much again in real practice time. That's nothing compared to the amount
        of practice the average native speaker gets, but if I keep this up for a few more years I might have a chance at
        sounding coherent :).
      </p>
      <h2>Looking forward</h2>
      <p>
        My advisor, Lydia, is often busy being a famous roboticist, so for the past year,
        <a href="https://wbthomason.com/">Wil</a> and <a href="https://zkingston.com/">Zak</a>, two postdocs in the lab,
        have handled day-to-day advising for me. However, they're both leaving to <del>get real jobs</del> further
        advance their careers.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means I'll have much less direct guidance in the future. My former-postdocs plan to keep in touch, but I
        expect I'll have to set a lot more of my own direction. This is a little alarming to me: I worry I'll spend
        months or years chasing some impossible or irrelevant topic. On the upside, though, it means I get to drill down
        into the stuff that I personally find cool!
      </p>
      <p>
        The arc of my thesis is also taking shape. My current guess is that my thesis will revolve around taking robot
        planning (in all its forms) into real-time applications. If I have my way, I'll make that happen with a mix of
        clever algorithms and software engineering, using a healthy amount of parallelism to crank out as much
        performance as possible, especially on limited hardware. Dovetailing with that, I want to try exploring ways of
        improving fault tolerance and dynamic perception in robotics, but I have fewer concrete ideas in mind for
        near-future approaches.
