        <h2>What even is Wordle?</h2>
        <p>
          In case you lived under a rock around 3 years ago, Wordle is a little word-guessing game developed by
          <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/">Josh Wardle</a>. The goal is to guess a five-letter English word by
          sampling different words. Every time you give a guess, you receive a <dfn>grade</dfn>, which is an assignment
          of five colors to the letters in your guess.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given some guess
          <math
            ><mrow><mi>w</mi></mrow></math
          >
          and solution word
          <math
            ><mrow><mi>s</mi></mrow></math
          >, the grade
          <math
            ><mrow><mi>g</mi></mrow></math
          >
          for letter
          <math
            ><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow></math
          >
          of a guess is defined as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If
            <math
              ><mrow
                ><msub><mi>w</mi><mi>i</mi></msub

            is green.
          </li>
          <li>
            If
            <math
              ><mrow

              ></math
            >
            and there is another letter
            <math
              ><mrow
                ><msub><mi>s</mi><mi>j</mi></msub
                ><mo>&#x0003D;</mo><msub><mi>w</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow
              ></math
            >, <em>and</em>
            <math
              ><mrow
                ><msub><mi>s</mi><mi>j</mi></msub></mrow

            >
            has not matched with an earlier letter
            <math
              ><mrow
                ><msub
                  ><mi>w</mi><mrow><mo>&#x0003C;</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub
                ></mrow
              ></math
            >, then
            <math
              ><mrow
                ><msub><mi>g</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow
              ></math
            >
            is yellow.
          </li>
          <li>
            Otherwise,
            <math
              ><mrow
                ><msub><mi>g</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow
              ></math
            >
            is black.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The yellow cases are the trickiest part. Here's an example: if we guessed <code>roses</code> against the
          solution <code>horse</code>, we would find that the <code>h</code> is black, since it appears nowhere in the
          solution. The <code>o</code> would be green, since it perfectly matches up between the guess and the solution,
          but <code>s</code> will be more complex. The first <code>s</code> in <code>roses</code> would be yellow, since
          it matches with the fourth letter of <code>horse</code>, but the second would be black, as there are no more
          <code>s</code> left for it to match in <code>horse</code> after satisfying the first <code>s</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lots of people like to go with an unconditional first two guesses - for instance, no matter the puzzle, my
          brother always opens with <code>trace</code> and <code>lions</code>. A natural question: given knowledge of
          the possible set of solutions <math><mi>S</mi></math> and the set of legal guesses
          <math><mi>W</mi><mo>⊇</mo><mi>S</mi></math
          >, what is the best unconditional opener?
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, it is actually quite difficult to answer this, as doing so would require evaluating every
          possible sequence of guesses, which would take enormous amounts of time. However, we can approximate the
          quality of an opener using entropy: every time we play an opener, we're given a pair of grades. There are only
          so many words which satisfy those grades. Given that we've received some grade <math><mi>g</mi></math> for our
          word <math><mi>w</mi></math
          >, let
          <math
            ><mrow
              ><msub><mi>c</mi><mi>g</mi></msub
              ><mo form="prefix" stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>w</mi><mo form="postfix" stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow
            ></math
          >
          be number of possible remaining words which could have given the grade. Then the expected remaining entropy
          after guessing <math><mi>w</mi></math> is the average of
          <math
            ><mrow
              ><msub><mi>c</mi><mi>g</mi></msub
              ><mo form="prefix" stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>w</mi><mo form="postfix" stretchy="false">)</mo
              ><mrow><mspace width="0.1667em"></mspace><mi>log</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mspace width="0.1667em"></mspace></mrow
              ><msub><mi>c</mi><mi>g</mi></msub
              ><mo form="prefix" stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>w</mi><mo form="postfix" stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow
            ></math
          >
          for every possible grade <math><mi>g</mi></math
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          To keep things simple, I won't go into the gritty details of why this is so good. There are a billion other
          articles on it, so go look up your favorite one if you'd like to learn more about the main. The rest of this
          article will be focused on pure performance engineering. In order to calculate the expected remaining
          information for every possible opener, we'll have to construct a grade for every combination of an opener and
          the true word. Wordle canonically has 12947 words with 2309 possible solutions, so that means we'd have to
          compute up to
          <math
            ><mrow><mn>12947</mn><mo>*</mo></mrow
            ><mrow><mn>12946</mn><mi>/</mi><mn>2</mn><mo>*</mo></mrow
            ><mrow><mn>2309</mn></mrow></math
          >
          total grades, or about 193 billion grades total. For the rest of this article, we're going to focus on
          churning through grade computation as fast as possible, in the hopes of getting out our optimal opener.

        <h2>The best first word</h2>
        <p>
          To start off, any naive solution won't be fast enough for finding the best two-word opener. In fact, even
          getting a benchmark for that would be a fool's errand. As a proxy for that, we'll start by looking at the best
          <em>one</em>-word opener; that is, the single first guess which minimizes the expected remaining entropy in
          the problem. Doing so will require
          <math
            ><mrow><mn>12947</mn><mo>*</mo></mrow
            ><mrow><mn>2309</mn></mrow></math
          >
          or just under 30 million grades.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>The simplest approach</h3>
          <p>
            I'll start off with a naive implementation of a grader to give a baseline for our future improvements. The
            simplest approach is to take two passes through the solution. On the first pass, we make note of all green
            letters in the grade, and write down any unmatched letters in the solution. On the second pass, we travel
            through the guessed word and mark any letters of the guess whcih correspond to an unmatched letter as
            yellow. To be fully general, we could store each word as a <code>&str</code>, each color as one member of an
            <code>enum</code>, and then give grades as a <code>Vec&lt;Color&gt;</code>. To store the set of unmatched
            letters, the most general version would be a <code>HashMap&lt;char, usize&gt;</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the rest of this article, I'll call the data structure which stores the number of unmatched characters
            in the solution the <dfn>yellow bank</dfn>, or just <dfn>bank</dfn> for short.
          </p>
          <pre class="Rust"><code>use std::collections::HashMap;

#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
enum Color {
    Black,
    Yellow,
    Green,
}

type Word = str;
type Grade = Vec&lt;Color&gt;;

fn grade(w: &Word, sol: &Word) -> Grade {
    assert_eq!(w.len(), sol.len());
    let mut bank: HashMap&lt;char, usize&gt; = HashMap::new();
    let mut grade = Vec::with_capacity(w.len());

    for (wc, sc) in w.chars().zip(sol.chars()) {
        if wc == sc {
            grade.push(Color::Green);
        } else {
            grade.push(Color::Black);
            *bank.entry(sc).or_default() += 1;
        }
    }


    for (wc, g) in w.chars().zip(&mut grade) {
        if let Some(c) = bank.get_mut(&wc) {
            if *c > 0 && *g == Color::Black {
                *c -= 1;
                *g = Color::Yellow;
            }
        }
    }

    grade
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            Without even running this code, it should be apparent that it's quite slow. Creating a
            <code>HashMap</code> and a <code>Vec</code> for every single grading means calling multiple allocations at
            each cycle, which is always disastrous for hot loops. Because of this, I won't even try to use it to
            calculate the best two-word opener. Instead, I'll do my comparisons of grading speed on a slightly smaller
            task: calculating the best single-word opener.
          </p>
          <p>
            To do this calculation, we'll need to compute the entropy after each possible opening guess, meaning we'll
            need to grade
            <math>
              <mrow>
                <mn>2309</mn>
                <mo>*</mo>
              </mrow>
              <mrow>
                <mn>12947</mn>
              </mrow>
            </math>
            words, or about 29 million.
          </p>
          <p>Without further ado, here are my results:</p>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Method</th>
              <th>Runtime (best 1 word)</th>
              <th>Average grading time</th>
              <th>Speedup</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Naive</td>
              <td>3.84s</td>
              <td>129ns</td>
              <td>1x 🏅</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>We'll populate this table with further rows as we implement new methods to compare against.</p>
          <p>
            And, if you care, the best unconditional single-word opener is <code>soare</code>, with an expected
            remaining information of 5.29 bits in the puzzle. For reference, the 2309 possible solutions to a Wordle
            problem require 11.2 bits of information, so this yields a pretty big jump in your knowledge of the puzzle!
            Since all other methods will be computing the same result, I won't bother reporting that, but instead we'll
            just calculate how long it takes them to do the same process.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>A little less naive</h3>
          <p>
            The obvious next step is to see if we can avoid the allocations in our implementation of <code>grade</code>.
            Actually, it's not too hard to do! We'll make a few key insights:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Every possible guess and solution has exactly 5 letters.</li>
            <li>Every possible guess and solution is exclusively made from ASCII characters</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Since words are only five letters, we can replace variable-length <code>str</code>s and <code>Vec</code>s
            with simple fixed-size arrays, preventing some allocations. Additionally, since all letters are lowercase
            ASCII, we can model each letter of each word as a number from 0 through 255 (inclusive), one for each ASCII
            codepoint.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once our letters are restricted, we can squint a little at our yellow-bank map. The values no longer need to
            be <code>usize</code>s, since the bank caps out at 5 letters saved per entry. Likewise, the keys are now
            just numbers from 0 through 255, so instead of using an expensive hash-map, we can just use a 256-element
            array of <code>u8</code> to store all our unmatched letters.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can put these insights together to make a very performant and allocation-free implementation of our grade
            function. I'll call this the "sensible" implementation.
          </p>
          <pre class="Rust"><code>type Word = [u8; 5];
type Grade = [Color; 5];

fn grade(w: Word, soln: Word) -> Grade {
    let mut bank = [0u8; 256];
    let mut grade = [Color::Black; 5];

    for ((wc, sc), g) in w.into_iter().zip(soln).zip(&mut grade) {
        if wc == sc {
            *g = Color::Green;
        } else {
            bank[sc as usize] += 1;
        }
    }

    for (wc, g) in w.into_iter().zip(&mut grade) {
        if *g == Color::Black && bank[wc as usize] &gt; 0 {
            bank[wc as usize] -= 1;
            *g = Color::Yellow;
        }
    }

    grade
}</code></pre>
          <p>This implementation gives us a respectable 5x improvement in speed.</p>

            Were I writing standard application code, I think this would have been a good place to stop. It requires a
            few assumptions, but they are mostly reasonable, and the code is in my opinion quite readable.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Were I wearing my software-engineer hat, I would be a lot more systematic about
            enforcing invariants for all my types. However, this is only a blog post, and so I play fast and loose with
            my code quality for sake of brevity.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Packing it all down</h3>
          <p>
            In the previous step, each <code>Word</code> was exactly 5 bytes. Often, if we pack our data into a single
            integer, we can get some big performance improvements, but the 3-byte overhead of a <code>u64</code> seems a
            little too big. Is there a better way?
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, maybe. We'll have to start with another restrictive assumption. Previously, we allowed any letter in a
            word to be a byte, so all values of a <code>u8</code> were fair game. In our dataset, however, we find that
            every word is a lowercase alphabetical string. This takes the number of possible characters from 256 to just
            26. Doing a little bit of math, the minimum data needed to represent 5 26-letter words is
            <math
              ><mrow
                ><mn>5</mn
                ><mrow><mspace width="0.1667em"></mspace><mi>log</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mspace width="0.1667em"></mspace></mrow
                ><mn>26</mn></mrow
              ></math
            >
            bits, or just over 23.5 bits. This is a good sign - that means we can represent each word as a
            <code>u32</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's actually even better than that. We only need 5 bits to represent each letter, so a packed array of 5
            words is only 25 bits. To get down to the theoretical minimum of 24 bits, we'd need to do
            multiplies-and-modulos to pack or extract each letter, but when representing each letter as its own
            independent bits, we can use (much faster) bitshift and masking operations.
          </p>
          <p>But enough talking! Let's get to the code. Let's start by redefining our <code>Word</code>s.</p>
          <pre class="Rust"><code>type Word = u32;</code></pre>
          <p>
            This is a packed representation, so for a word <code>w</code>, to get the <code>i</code>-th letter of
            <code>w</code>, we can unpack it with a bit-shift and mask - to extract out the letter, simply compute
            <code>(w >> (5 * i)) & 0b11111</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Likewise, each <code>Color</code> is only one of three values, so we can pack <code>Color</code>s into two
            bits. With five <code>Color</code>s per grade, then we can pack a <code>Grade</code> into a single
            <code>u16</code>.
          </p>
          <pre clas="Rust"><code>type Grade = u16;</code></pre>
          <p>
            Finally, each entry in the yellow bank can have a maximum of 5 letters, so each entry needs only 3 bits.
            Across all 26 letters, that means we can fit the entire yellow bank in 78 bits, so we can fit it in a single
            <code>u128</code>. Putting this all together, we can take the previous sensible implementation and convert
            it to use packed integers instead of arrays.
          </p>
          <pre class="Rust"><code>const GREEN: u16 = 0b10;
const YELLOW: u16 = 0b01;
const BLACK: u16 = 0b00;

fn grade(guess: Word, soln: Word) -&gt; Grade {

        if matches_bottom_5 {
            grade |= GREEN &lt;&lt; 10;
        } else {
            let sc = soln2 & 0x1f;

        }

          <h3>Going for a squeeze</h3>
          <p>
            We're now reaching the point where it's actually quite difficult to come up with any more optimizations.
            However, there's one more place that I thought of to optimize, and it's going to require one last
            assumption.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you scroll through the list of answers, you'll notice that they're all relatively normal English words.
            Normal English words tend to have a nice mix of vowels and consonants, and the list contains no degenerate
            onamotopoeia like <code>aaaaa</code>. The result:
            <strong>every word on the answer list contains no more than 3 duplicate letters.</strong> (This is true for
            the word list too, but it's not relevant to the optimization).
          </p>
          <p>
            We can use that upper bound on duplicate letters to shrink our yellow-letters bank. We now only need 2 bits
            per letter to represent every entry in the yellow bank, so we can fit the whole thing in a single
            <code>u64</code>. Generally speaking, <code>u128</code> arithmetic is quite slow, so this is a big
            improvement for our performance. I'll call this implementation <strong>squeeze</strong>, since we squeeze
            everything down as tightly as it can go.
          </p>
          <p>Otherwise, the code is about the same, so I'm hiding the source behind the spoiler dropdown below.</p>

          <h3>Multiple data, multiple problems</h3>
          <p>
            We've just about exhausted all of our sequential performance capacity. However, computers can do a lot more
            with a lot more than one operation at a time! If you've seen any of my
            <a href="/blog/captree">real work</a>, you might know that I'm a big fan of single-instruction,
            multiple-data (SIMD) parallelism.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using SIMD, we have access to special instructions on our CPU. Ordinary instructions let us do fine-grained
            atomic operations, such as adding two numbers together. SIMD instructions take that one step further: we use
            one instruction to do many (typically 4 or 8) of the same operation on many values. The chief difficulty of
            using SIMD is that <strong>every unit of parallelism must be doing the same thing</strong>. In other words,
            if our sequential code has an if-else-statement in it, the parallelized version must execute both branches
            of that statement. Fortunately for us, though, our squeezed SIMD parallel algorithm has very few
            if-statements, and the bodies that they execute are quite cheap.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next problem is (once again) the yellow bank. If we are grading <code>L</code> guesses in parallel, then
            we could represent our guess and solution words as a vector of <code>L</code> <code>u32</code>s, but the
            yellow bank would have to be a vector of <code>L</code> <code>u64</code>s. Converting between two different
            lane widths is very expensive in SIMD code, so we need to use the same integers for both the words and the
            yellow bank. However, if we expand each lane to use a <code>u64</code> for each word, then we've wasted half
            our parallelism.
          </p>
          <p>
            My solution: split the bank in half. We'll make two SIMD vectors to represent the yellow bank. The first
            vector can hold the entries in the bank corresponding to the first 16 letters of the alphabet, while the
            second vector can hold the entries corresponding to the last 10. The chief benefit is that we now only need
            to use <code>u32</code>s to represent our data, so we can dodge all the transfer costs for changing lane
            sizes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, this complicates the process of actually fetching and storing numbers in the yellow bank. To make
            this all work, we have to construct a bitmask for each character of the solution, and then mask every single
            operation involving the yellow bank with operations like <code>select</code>. But after a little finagling,
            it's all possible!

            The above code is as fast as it is incomprehensible. It's polymorphic over the lane count, so we can run our
            benchmarks for each lane count to see which is fastest. My computer supports up to AVX2, so I expected the
            8-lane implementation to be the fastest.

        <p>
          And we get great performance boosts! Our final performance for the SIMD approach runs fifty times faster than
          the original naive implementation. However, our numbers for average grading time are no longer truly
          meaningful, since I calculated them by dividing the total grades required by the total time taken, so the
          average times are a representation of throughput, not latency.

        <h3>Turbo-parallelism</h3>
        <p>
          If going parallel in SIMD worked well for us, then going parallel with threads will probably work great too.
          Luckily, selecting the best word is an embarrasingly parallel problem: at the end of the day, all we're doing
          is calculating a minimum.
        </p>
        <p>
          For our first-word benchmark, we'll divvy up the 12947 guess words into a chunk for every thread. For
          instance, if we have 32 threads, each thread gets either 404 or 405 guess words in its chunk. Each thread
          computes the best word in its apportioned chunk, then once all threads are done, we select the best word from
          all the chunks.
        </p>

    let mut best_ent = f32::INFINITY;

    for handle in handles {
        let (ent, id) = handle.join().unwrap();

        <p>
          My one gripe about this code is I have to manually implement the minimization loop twice. Normally, I would
          use <code>Iterator::min</code>, but since floating-point numbers lack total order, we have to roll our own
          <code>min</code> implementation for floats.

            version.

        </figure>
        <p>
          When we run the benchmarks, we see pretty good per-thread scaling! The performance grows linearly with the
          number of threads until we reach 16 threads. I think the reason for the sudden dropoff is a quirk of processor
          architecture. On the 7950X, there are 32 threads on 16 cores, so the 17th thread has to share a core with
          another thread. This causes contention and produces a performance drop. As the thread count increases, the
          performance gains slow, and then start to drop at the very end.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we want to eke out more performance, though, we'll need to give each thread a little more flexibility in
          its schedule. There are currently two limitations to this method:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            We have to wait for the slowest thread. Even though each thread theoretically gets the same work, sometimes
            one thread will take extra time. The remaining threads have to sit around waiting for the slow thread to
            finish up instead of contributing meaningful work.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we want to scale up to finding the best two-word opener, we'll have to spawn a bunch of threads thousands
            of times. The overhead is pretty small compared to the grading time, but it adds up when we're trying to
            solve a massive number of problems.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I'll solve both of these issues later, but for now, just know that there's a better way to go about it - I
          shall discuss it in detail shortly. For now, I'll leave you with the final first-round scaling table.

        <h2>The super-solver</h2>
        <p>
          Our grader is now fast enough that we can actually move on to trying to solve the original problem: finding
          the best unconditional two-word opener. However, there are still a few optimizations left! Right now, checking
          every possible opener on a single thread would take about 42 minutes, which isn't horrible, but it's more than
          I have patience for.

          <h3>Pruning it down</h3>
          <p>
            Not all words are made equal. <code>salon</code> and <code>trice</code> might be a great opener, but
            <code>qajaq</code> followed immediately by <code>qajaq</code> again is probably not so good. Ideally, we'd
            like to avoid doing such a poor job at grading at all possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can take a branch-and-bound approach: at any point in our search, we know the best possible opener so far
            will leave us with expected remaining entropy

          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>The new word order</h3>
          <p>
            Once we have this pruning technique, the next step is obvious: we want to get the best possible value of
            \(\hat H_\text{start}\) to prune as many guesses as possible. We can't assume we've been given the truth,
            since that would be cheating, but we do already have an excellent proxy for finding out which guesses might
            be good. We can just use the words which minimize the remaing entropy.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my implementation, I did a triangular search: we work our way downward in the list of words by remaining
            entropy. The best three single-word openers are <code>soare</code>, <code>roate</code>, and
            <code>raise</code>, so we'd start by checking <code>soare, roate</code>, then <code>soare, raise</code>, and
            finally <code>roate, raise</code>. I decided to skip repeated word pairs as it's pretty obvious that they
            wouldn't be any good.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Parallelism, round 2</h3>
          <p>
            Finally, we can circle back around to building a multithreaded solver. We'd like to build a parallel system
            which is sufficiently coarse-grained that each thread doesn't waste time coordinating, but also ensures that
            each thread is always fed with work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The easiest way to do this is with a task queue: at the start of the program, we spin out all the worker
            threads. All the threads share a list of tasks that they need to work on; whenever a thread is done with its
            current task, it grabs the next task from the list. In the general case, the main issue with task queues is
            that if they are too fine-grained the contention over the next item in the task queue will cause slowdowns.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have a very easy workaround, though. Let's imagine that our program has been given \(|W|\) valid guess
            words. The number of words is known to us at the start of the program. We can then represent the next word
            in the task queue as a single integer representing the index of the next word. Then each thread can acquire
            a new task by incrementing a single number, with no other coordination required. Once a thread has acquired
            a word \(w\), it can test every single pair of words \(w, w'\), which will take a decent chunk of time. The
            whole queue is quite easy to implement, since we can just store our task queue state as a single
            <code>AtomicUsize</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last problem sharing our minimum information so far. If we had atomic floats, we could use fetch-min
            operations to update our lower bound on the expected remaining information. However, most CPU archtectures
            do not support such operations. Instead, we can do a cheap trick: convert every float to a fixed-point
            number. In my case, I just approximated the remaining entropy to the nearest one-millionth, then did all the
            multithreaded operations with integers.
          </p>
          <p>The final result: we were able to get our unconditional openers in just 15 seconds.</p>

        <h2>Closing time</h2>
        <p>
          I had a lot of fun doing this project! I feel a little bad about taking so long to write it up - I started
          working on it about a year ago, tabled the project, and only recently restarted about 2 months ago. It's nice
          to be finally (sort of) finished!
        </p>
        <p>
          I especially liked the process of building out faster and faster versions of the grader. The coolest part to
          me was that there was a continous gradient between generality and performance: we can keep adding stronger and
          stronger assumptions, getting a small performance bump every time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I probably didn't save any time working on this: the naive implementation is only a few hundred times slower
          than the final parallel version, so finding the best unconditional opener with the naive solution would have
          only required about 3 hours of computation. I certainly wasted far more than 3 hours optimizing this
          implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have to apologize: the title is a bit of a stretch (sorry for clickbaiting you). I calculated it
          approximately by dividing the total number of checks required by the number time taken. The reason it's not so
          accurate is that the pruning process significantly reduces the number of checks required, so our real grading
          throughput is more along the lines of just a few billion grades per second.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I come back to this project, I want to aim my sights a little higher. I think it's reasonably possible to
          calculate the true optimal policy for solving Wordle. All the solvers out there (including this one) use
          entropy as a decent approximation of guess quality, but it doesn't actually provide any guarantee that we
          minimize our average-case or worst-case number of guesses required. I want to see if it's possible to do so,
          but my back-of-the-napkin math suggests that a brute force approach would take literally years on a dedicated
          compute cluster to do it. I have a few ideas churning around, so if I get the chance, I might give it a shot,
          but I make no guarantees.
