        TL;DR: Local programmer is inconvenienced by error-handling boiler plate, writes uninformed article about
        experimental programming language features. More at 11.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've encountered lots of pain points when dependency-inverting things, especially when working with combinators.
        Most recently, I've been thinking about how I might expose Python bindings for a
        <a href="https://github.com/claytonwramsey/rumple">half-baked motion planning library</a> I'm building. The
        chief problem is that I want users to provide their own configuration spaces, samplers, robots, and collision
        checkers. If those are implemented in Python, they can throw an exception at any time, yielding an error in the
        corresponding PyO3 API. The problem is that all of my functions which might call into that behavior doesn't
        return an error - what am I to do?
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not the only one with this sort of problem!
        <a href="https://without.boats/blog/the-problem-of-effects/">boats</a> has been writing about this for nearly
        five years, and
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63798662">handling iterators of results is still a pain</a>. As the
        <code>async</code> story for Rust has improved, we've seen similar results on the pain (or lack thereof) of
        <a href="https://morestina.net/blog/1686/rust-async-is-colored">function coloring in Rust</a>. In short,
        crossing control-flow boundaries in statically typed languages is painful and difficult.
      </p>
      <h2>Dependency inversion</h2>
      <p>
        For the sake of this post, I'll refer to <dfn>dependency inversion</dfn> as the practice of taking a subroutine
        in a procedure and taking it out as an argument. For example, consider the following Rust code:
      </p>
      <pre class="rust"><code>fn my_sum() -> u32 {
    let mut total = 0;
    for i in 0..10 {
        total += magic_number(i);
    }
    total
}

fn magic_number(x: u32) -> u32 { x }</code></pre>
      This would be a case of an <em>uninverted</em> dependency; that is, <code>my_sum</code> depends on
      <code>magic_number</code> and knows it specifically by name. However, if we factored out
      <code>magic_number</code> into a user provided file, this would invert the dependency:
      <pre class="rust"><code>fn my_sum&lt;N: MagicNumber&gt;() -> u32 {
    let mut total = 0;
    for i in 0..10 {
        total += N::magic_number(i);
    }
    total
}

trait MagicNumber {
    fn magic_number(x: u32) -> u32;
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        This has a lot of benefits, mostly for code reuse. We can now use these generic functions to build simple
        combinators and compose them into bigger things!
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, this toy example is pretty close to what a simple iterator combinator (such as
        <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.sum"><code>std::iterator::Sum</code></a
        >) does. For the most part, people are quite happy with it and it gets the job done.
      </p>
      <h2>My problem</h2>
      <p>
        What if a user-provided <code>magic_number</code> implementation is fallible? Perhaps it requires file I/O, or
        has a chance of dividing by zero, or maybe it calls out to some FFI code. In current Rust, we have a few
        prospects:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Panic! Whenever <code>magic_number</code> encounter's an error state, we can just crash the program. This
          works fine until you are woken up at 3 A.M. with calls about your broken website.
        </li>
        <li>
          Panic, but gracefully. Whatever top-level code calls <code>my_sum</code> can catch the panic using
          <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html"><code>catch_unwind</code></a
          >. The catch with catching is that unwinding is slow and unpredictable. In fact, programs compiled with
          <code>panic = "abort"</code> will never catch a panic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go nuclear. Make a copy of <code>MagicNumber</code> specifically for the case of fallible implementations of
          <code>magic_number</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The nuclear option would look something like this.</p>
      <pre class="rust"><code>fn try_my_sum&lt;N: TryMagicNumber&gt;() -> u32 {
    let mut total = 0;
    for i in 0..10 {
        total += N::try_magic_number(i)?;
    }
    total
}

trait TryMagicNumber {
    type Error;
    fn try_magic_number(x: u32) -> Result&lt;u32, Self::Error&gt;;
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        So, with a little bit of brute force, we've come up with an API that can handle fallibility. It's annoying to
        maintain, sure, but at least we've achieved maximum flexibility. But wait! What if we want to make an
        implementation of <code>magic_number</code> using an unsafe function! Then we'd have to make a new trait!
      </p>
      <pre class="rust"><code>trait UnsafeMagicNumber {
    type Error;
    unsafe fn unsafe_magic_number(x: u32) -> u32;
}</code></pre>
      <p>And what if we want to use this functionality with a function that was both unsafe and fallible?</p>
      <pre class="rust"><code>trait TryUnsafeMagicNumber {
    type Error;
    unsafe fn try_unsafe_magic_number(x: u32) -> Result&lt;u32, Self::Error&gt;;
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        Now imagine if we wanted to make a version of <code>magic_number</code> that worked via dynamic-dispatch, so
        we'd make a new object-safe trait for that too. Then we'd need to make even more traits for every version of it!
      </p>
      <pre class="rust"><code>trait ObectMagicNumber {
    fn object_magic_number(&self, x: u32) -> u32;
}

trait TryObjectMagicNumber { /* ... */ }
trait UnsafeObjectMagicNumber { /* ... */ }
trait TryUnsafeObjectMagicNumber { /* ... */ }</code></pre>
      <p>
        Then we have to consider all the many other variations on this once-simple API: mutability, allocations, I/O,
        blocking, <code>const</code>, <code>async</code>. The list goes on. If we had
        <math>
          <mi>n</mi>
        </math>
        such properties, we'd need to create
        <math
          ><msup><mn>2</mn><mi>n</mi></msup></math
        >
        traits and
        <math
          ><msup><mn>2</mn><mi>n</mi></msup></math
        >
        functions to handle them all. Each one of these variations is reasonable, but we know that since we can't accept
        all of them, we must accept none of them.
      </p>
      <h2>What are effects, anyway?</h2>
      <p>
        Intuitively, effects are a way of trying to abstract away all these possible variations on a function in a clean
        and generic way. Every function has some set of effects, and effects are inherited: if
        <math><mi>f</mi></math> has effect <math><mi>E</mi></math
        >, and <math><mi>g</mi></math> calls <math><mi>f</mi></math
        >, then <math><mi>g</mi></math> also has effect <math><mi>E</mi></math
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        To build some examples, let's make a new fake programming language called RustE (Rust, with Effects). We'll make
        only a few syntactic changes, allowing the creation of effects and for effects to be annotated with a
        <code>can</code> clause describing their effects.
      </p>
      <pre class="rust"><code>effect Bar {}

fn foo() can Bar {
    println!("bar!");
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        If we made a new function <code>baz</code> which called <code>foo</code>, <code>baz</code> would also have to
        have the effect <code>Bar</code>.
      </p>
      <pre class="rust"><code>fn baz() {
    foo();
    // compile error! baz() calls foo(), which has effect Bar, but baz() cannot Bar!
}

fn qux() can Bar {
    foo(); // this is ok though
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        To avoid the
        <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function">function coloring</a>
        problem, we'll also allow for <code>handle</code> clauses, with allow a function without an effect to call a
        function with an effect.
      </p>
      <pre clas="rust"><code>fn baz2() {
    handle Bar {} {
        // Bar was handled, so no compile error
        foo();
    }
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        We can add some texture by letting effects also call procedures which go all the way up to their handlers. The
        handler can choose to resume, returning execution to the effect caller, or to
        <code>break</code>, escaping from the handler to the scope outside the handler.
      </p>
      <pre class="rust"><code>effect GetWidget {
    fn make_widget() -> u32;
}

fn eat_widgets() can GetWidget {
    loop {
        let w = GetWidget::make_widget();
        println!("mm, tasty {w}");
    }
}

fn feed_widgets() {
    let mut widgets = vec![1, 2, 3];
    handle GetWidget {
        fn make_widget() -> u32 {
            match widgets.pop() {
                Some(w) => w,
                None => break,
            }
        }
    } {
        eat_widgets();
    }
    println!("out of widgets :(");
}

// expected output:
// ----------------
// mm, tasty 3
// mm, tasty 2
// mm, tasty 1
// out of widgets :(</code></pre>
      <p>Our final wrinkle: effects and their functions may have generic types!</p>
      <pre class="rust"><code>effect Fail&lt;E&gt; {
    fn fail(e: E) -> !;
}

fn do_my_best(x: u32) can Fail&lt;&'static str&gt; {
    if x == 0 {
        Fail::fail("can't divide by zero");
    } else {
        println!("{}", 1 / x);
    }
}

fn main() {
    handle Fail<&'static str> {
        fn fail(s: &'static str) -> ! {
            println!("{s}");
            break;
        }
    } {
        do_my_best(1);
        do_my_best(0);
    }
}</code></pre>
      <h2>Effects can model lots of kinds of functions</h2>
      <p>
        We can model many language features as special cases as effects. In fact, the handling the effect
        <code>Fail</code> in the example above is equivalent to a <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code> statement with
        checked exceptions!
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>unsafe</code> is also pretty trivially an effect - any function which is unsafe can have the
        <code>Unsafe</code> effect, while any <code>unsafe</code> block desugars to a handler. If you added effects to
        the original Rust language, it might be possible to integrate them in a backward-compatible way into the
        language.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same applies for <code>async</code>, I/O, and allocations. If you squint hard enough, you might be able to
        imagine a case where interior mutability is a sort of effect handler too. Surprisingly enough,
        <code>const</code> isn't really an effect, but non-<code>const</code> code is! Non-<code>const</code> code can
        call <code>const</code> functions, but not the other way around, so running at runtime is the effect. I suppose
        you could alternately come up with "contravariant" effects, by which any function with contravariant effect
        <math
          ><msup><mi>E</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" class="tml-prime">′</mo></msup></math
        >
        may only call functions which also have the effect
        <math
          ><msup><mi>E</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" class="tml-prime">′</mo></msup></math
        >. Then <code>const</code> would be one such contravariant effect, but, honestly, it's not worth the hassle.
      </p>
      <h2>Effect polymorphism comes in</h2>
      <p>
        In the same way that a function could be polymorphic over types (as with generics), why not have functions be
        polymorphic over <em>effects</em>? If we return to our original example of <code>my_sum</code>, we can fold all
        the possible versions of <code>my_sum</code> from
        <math>
          <msup>
            <mn>2</mn>
            <mi>n</mi>
          </msup>
        </math>
        variants to just one.
      </p>
      <pre class="rust"><code>trait MagicNumber {
    effect Effect;
    fn magic_number(x: u32) -> u32 can Self::Effect;
}

fn my_sum&lt;N: MagicNumber&gt;() -> u32 can N::Effect {
    let mut total = 0;
    for i in 0..10 {
        total += N::magic_number(i);
    }
    total
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        I'm pretty happy with this! There's very little ceremony involved, and we get to express vastly more things than
        we could before!
      </p>
      <p>Of course, once we have something like this system, there are a lot of obvious questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is there a complement to <code>type _ = impl Trait</code> for effects?</li>
        <li>How should effects compose?</li>
        <li>Can we treat effects like data?</li>
        <li>Can we do introspection or reflection on effects?</li>
        <li>Can we do dynamic-dispatch on effects at runtime?</li>
        <li>If Rust also got linear types, how would they compose with cancellation in effect handlers?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For now, though, it would be really nice to just write code which is polymorphic over its effects.</p>
      <h2>I'm no closer to fixing my Python issues</h2>
      <p>
        It's one thing to muse about a solution to my problem and another thing entirely to actually solve it. As much
        as I would like to go completely down the rabbit hole and implement a dream language with algebraic effects,
        linear types, trait-based polymorphism, and zero-cost abstraction, I also have to get my projects done some time
        this century.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's been a lot of ink spilled about efficiently compiling algebraic effects, but at the time of writing
        there's no mainstream programming language that does so. <a href="https://github.com/koka-lang/koka">Koka</a> is
        probably the closest thing that we have to such a language, but it's admittedly not production-ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, I will probably end up just making code that has weird effects panic. It's not the best choice, but
        it's good enough for now.
