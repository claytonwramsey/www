This is my website! I keep a lot of things here, most of them because I find them interesting, or perhaps
because I don't want to forget about them. I hope you enjoy browsing this website as much as I enjoyed making
it.

Check out the links up at the top if you'd like to explore.

## News

- **2025-02-05**: I've been invited to give a talk at the [Rust for Robotics Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/r4rworkshop) at [ICRA 2025](https://2025.ieee-icra.org/) in Atlanta this May!
  I'll be talking about my recent and upcoming work on efficient motion planning as well as task and motion planning.
- **2024-06-08**: My paper "Collision-Affording Point Trees:
  SIMD-Amenable Nearest Neighbors for Fast Collision Checking" was
  accepted at [Robotics: Science and
  Systems](https://roboticsconference.org) in Delft in the
  Netherlands. I\'ll be presenting it on July 16! For more details,
  check out my [blog post](/blog/captree) or the
  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02807).
- **2024-04-24**: I'll be presenting a poster on my recent work in

## About this website

This website is pretty simple.
It's currently generated via [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) with a custom lightweight theme.
I\'m a big fan of
[various](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com)
[efforts](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com) to use HTML\'s existing
qualities for accessibility and design. I think that the web should be
designed around simple, handmade things and believe that I can be a part
of that.
